This document will provide some rules in order to make our code error and bug free

**** Rules : To be applied in a class

1. Include namespace, if a class is inside a particular file in the 'classes' folder

**** Rules : For error and bug free coding

    1. Always add a try-catch or if-else block for a code if you think, it might give some error in the future
    2. Do a through and proper testing, once a code is written, and only then move on to the next part !!
    3. Use a substitute data, incase if the actual data is empty 
        Ex: return count($this->all()) ? true : false;
    

**** Rules : For understanding the functionality of a 'class' and a 'function'

    1. Always write what the function does in this format: 
    /**
     * @return true if the session is active
     * otherwise @return false   
     */
